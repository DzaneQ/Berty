Berty is a game whose author and card designer is Hubert Gulczyński. The game has been developed in Unity 2020.3-2022.3 by Patryk Szczęśniak.

The game is still in progress but it's functional and playable. The code is in English but displayed text and some custom names (character names) in the code are in Polish.

Some basic instructions:

- Each turn you're given cards which you can put on either of 9 fields by clicking on a card then on a field.
- Every time you put a card on the field, you're required to pay with other cards by clicking them then clicking on the card on the field to confirm payment.
- Before confirming the payment, you can rotate or cancel the card as you wish by clicking appropriate arrows or the cancel button on the top-right corner. 
- You can move or rotate your card by clicking appropriate arrows or launch an attack by clicking the card itself but you need to pay with other cards.
- End turn with the top-right corner button when you don't have enough cards to make a move.
- Win condition: get 6 cards on the field before your opponent.

Each card has crucial stats including:
- squares on the left - attack range;
- squares on the right - defense range (only neighboring fields apply, no diagonal):
  - orange square with X - the card attacked from the specified field will take damage (same applies from diagonal and distant fields);
  - white square (neighboring only, no diagonal) - the card attacked from the specified field will take damage and attack the attacking card;
  - blue square with B - the card attacked from the specified field will take no damage;
- green bar - strength - indicates how much health attacked cards lose;
- blue bar - power - indicates how many cards you must pay with to put the card on the field;
- yellow bar - dexterity - the missing part indicates how many cards you must pay with to move/rotate/attack;
- red bar - health - as long as it's more than 0, the card stays on the field.

Those are basics but there's more in the game.
